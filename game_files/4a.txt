You enroll in the program and learn the basics of
iOS app development using the Swift programming language
and Xcode, Apple's development environment.

You develop your first iOS apps using layouts, views,
UIKit, and more.

You progress to build more complex and advanced applications,
using networking, and Appleâ€™s Grand Central Dispatch
and Core Data.

You publish your capstone project to the App Store.

Yay!
