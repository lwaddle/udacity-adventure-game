You discover a responsive website that looks beautiful
on both mobile and desktop devices.

You spend some time clicking around and 
come across the Udacity Program Catalog.

There are so many programs!

You have an interest in two of the programs:

- Full Stack Developer and
- iOS Developer

To help you decide which route to take, you roll a pair of dice.

If the sum of the dice is even, become a Full Stack Developer.

If the sum of the dice is odd, become an iOS Developer.
